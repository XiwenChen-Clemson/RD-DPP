# RD-DPP
The code for the paper: RD-DPP: Rate-Distortion Theory meets Determinantal Point Process to Diversify Learning Data Samples

## We currently provide:
- ``` prop1.py```: Proposition 1 for different distributions:
'Gaussian','Uniform', 'Beta', 'Binomial','Exponential','Rayleigh','Poisson'

- ```main.py```: Training for Models with neural collapse (merely pursuing diversity). The function is ```RD_DPP_diveristy```.
- ```code_diversity_empirical_old``` is the function to obtain ```sdiv(x)``` with boostrapping.
